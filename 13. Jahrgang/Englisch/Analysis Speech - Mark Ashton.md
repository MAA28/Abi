In the following I will analyse a speech held by Mark Ashton, the leader and co-founder of lesbians and gays support the miners. He is inspired to do so by the tragic passing of Clifford's brother and tries to motivate the disenchanted miners to stay strong and count on the LGSMs efforts to support the strike.

The speech starts of by Mark and his group taking the responsibility for troubles the miners and their families are going through.

Mark humanizes the National Coal Board by using a personification. In the lines 18-20 Mark states that the event that they will organize is going to have the National Coal Board “crawling on their hands and knees, in full drag, to beg you for forgiveness”.
