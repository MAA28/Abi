In the short story "Cicada" by Camille Acker, she deals with the struggles of the black community in the USA by showing the hardship of the young afro-american piano prodigy - Ellery.

The story begins with a Ellery and her parents being driven by their neighbor Ms. Anita to a piano competition in a rather rich part of DC.  It turns out that the family of Ellery is not able to afford the car repairs. Their journey takes them through the so called “Gold Coast” and Ellery is stunned by the state of the buildings is surprised by the cleanliness in the neighborhood. The competition takes place in a synagogue and upon arrival Ellery jumps out of the car. The Cook’s enter the building and get seated meanwhile Ellery is escorted to the back by her piano teacher Ms. Hamilton and is introduced to two girls her age Lori and Cara. Lori goes on to make inappropriate remarks on Ellery's hair. Even before the start of the competition Ellery feels like an outcast among the primarily white audience. Ellery ends upon performing great and wins the competition for her age group of 9–12 year olds, before she had again been made fun of by Lori. Ellery wins a 500-dollar savings check, which she wants to gift to her parents. They however turn her down and in turn Ellery is disappointed. When leaving Ellery has an emotional outburst and goes on to chase the car in which Lori leaves the competition. While running she hurls Cicada shells at the car.
