In the short story "Cicada" by Camille Acker, she deals with the struggles of the black community in the USA by showing the hardship of the young afro-american piano prodigy - Ellery.

The story begins with a Ellery and her parents being driven by their neighbor Ms. Anita to a piano competition in a rather rich part of DC. The child is surprised by the cleanliness in the neighborhood.
