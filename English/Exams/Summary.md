Use your own words!
Use *simple present*!
Write about 1/3 of the original text!
Use an analytical style, not a narrative one! You dont need to stick to the chronological order!
- Don't retell the plot! (No: He says... and then she says...)
Be as concise as possible, be as detailed as necessary!
A reader who does not know the original text needs to understand it by reading your summary.
