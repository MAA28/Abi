The character Ellery is makes it's first appearance in short story "Cicada", which was written by Camille Acker and published in the book "Training School for N\*\*\*\* Girls".

The character, whose full name is Ellery Cook (cf. I. 423), is a black (cf. II. 306) pubescent (cf. 385 f.) piano prodigy (cf. II. 85).  

Ellery is uncommonly mature for compared to her peers. This shows must strongly in her objective of winning the 500$ price money instead of the first-place award (cf. II. 430 f.). Additionally her interest in the natural sciences, demonstrated by her handling of the crushed cicadas (cf. II. 24 f.) and behavior in school (cf. II. 26), show a great deal of maturity.

*Ellery seem to be ahead of her peers, she for example does not feel disgusted by the crushed cicadas but seems to be interested (cf. ll. 24f). Next to her interest in Piano she also seems to be keen of science in school, citing her own science teacher (cf. ll. 26). Ellery goes on to win the competition and despite the euphoria she eyes the 500 dollars check instead of her first-place award (cf. ll. 430f.). Ellery is not excited for herself, but rather wants to finance a car for her family (cf. ll. 461f.). This shows two things, her selflessness and readiness to support her family and her young age, due to her not realising that she holds a saving check that will be worth 500 dollars in the future.*

The Cooks don't seem to be very well off. An example of that is that the families car is so old that they had to driven to the competition Ellery was participating in by Ms. Anita (cf. II. 63f.).

*We learn that Ellery and her family have not had the easiest time and do not appear to be wealthy. It is stated that they have not had a car for a long time, hence why they are chauffeured to the piano competition by Ms. Anita (cf. ll. 63f.).*

Ellery isn't that enthusiastic about her playing piano, nevertheless she does find something in it, describing it as a "world with not start and no stop" (cf. II. 50 f.).

*Ellery herself is not only intrigued by playing the piano, but she also describes the feeling of playing piano as a world with “no start and no stop” (cf. ll. 50f.). *



*Through out the story Ellery presents the ability to interpret her surroundings and seem to present these circumstances metaphorically (cf. ll. 425f.).*

Though clearly passionate for her family, she strives towards more independents form her parents. A symbol of that is her desire to cut her hair (cf. II. 220 f.).

*She wants to more independent from her parents, wanting to cut her hair and be more grown up (cf. ll. 220f.).*

Ellery is used to being isolated and being treated as a misfit. Her experience doesn't stop her from feeling uncomftable in    

*It becomes clear that Ellery seems used to being singled out and to not fit in, this however does not help her feeling uneasy in situation like these (cf. ll. 246). *

*Ellery as character represents the difficulties that young Afro-American girls face. Singled out, growing up in a poor family she is being teased by her peers. Despite all of this she remains, even in face of her young age, focused for the competition and finally winning it. Her winning can be seen as a critic of the classism and racism that plagues America. Towards the end Ellery is not able to control her emotions and all the build up tension is released towards Lori.*
