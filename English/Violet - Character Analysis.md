Violet posses a distinct appearance with green eyes, blond hair, a big chest, and a "bubble butt" (ll.141-143) this in addition to tallness of five feet eight inches (ca. 1.7 m) lead to her being compared to Pamela Anderson's. Nonetheless she has self-confidence, sociability, and a high self-esteem. An example of that would be her directness with the salesgirl in the store (ll.87). Her confidence shows that she doesn't care about what others think of her.

Violet feels responsible for Fatima's transformation. She plans to teach her origin and teach her how to flirt better (ll.170, 328).

Violet stands up against racism, as she can't stand the behavior of some "cocky" white people and their prejudices (ll.249f). In the passage where Fatima lies to her about not being free for the weekend, Violet shows her honesty and openness by believing her instantly without questioning anything she said (ll.412-424).

Finally, Violet's disappointment, betrayal, and gloominess are visible when she finds out that Fatima has a boyfriend and was lying to her. She feels this way because she expected Fatima to talk to her instead of walking away with her boyfriend (ll.537).
